Even though he has a lot of blind sides [1], he constantly sees opportunities for cons, having to resist the urge to commit to them. He is loyal and very protective of those close to him. He speaks convincingly [1], lightly, assertively, and confidently, even when under pressure to perform. Nagel describes him as having style and brio. For all of his pulled jobs, Danny has a great deal of foresight to overcome any changes affecting his plans and to be one step ahead of his targets.
